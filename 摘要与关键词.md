# 摘要

随着科技越来越深入人们的生活，网络课程在网上越来越多，人们学习编程技术的门槛越来越低，越来越多的人走进了代码的世界。我们希望将来的生活能与科技结合起来，使我们感受到原来科技的进步可以帮助到我们这么多事情。作为大学生，我们发现随着社团的不断发展与人数的增加，其管理难度与人员的信息量也同样日益变大，传统的人工管理模式已经不能满足现在的社团需求。传统的管理方式存在许多缺陷，比如人员信息数据维护效率低下，不易保管储存，容易丢失一些数据，文档等等。为了弥补以上缺点，我分析了当今社团管理状况，开发出一套通用的，灵活的专门为社团管理使用的工具式软件，帮助他们更好里管理人员报名，考核，通知等一系列工作。本课题就是以这一目标创立，并总结了各社团的需求，详细讲解了社团集成工具式管理系统的设计，分析与实现方法。

本社团管理系统主要包含六个轻量级的工具，来协助社团管理员管理成员，分别是：报名管理，考核系统，短信通知平台，值班表制作工具，学习讨论平台，邮件通知平台。因为它们各自功能的不同，所以我们选用了3种不同的技术去开发这六大工具来加快开发效率。结合着优秀的开源框架与 GitHub 上众多的开源项目，在网站开发的基础之上，最终设计并实现了这套社团管理这套集成工具式系统。我相信这种工具化，多样化，网络化的管理平台是大部分大学社团所需要的一种管理技术，特别是在人群范围广，深受大学生欢迎的学生社团，这种技术能帮助他们的管理上层让社团走在规范化，科技化，高效率的道路上。真正从单一型管理向综合型转变。

# Abstract

As technology becomes more and more in-depth in people's lives, more and more online courses are on the Internet, and the threshold for people to learn programming techniques is getting lower and lower, and more and more people are entering the world of code. We hope that life in the future can be combined with science and technology so that we can feel that the advances in science and technology can help us with so many things. As college students, we find that with the continuous development of the community and the increase in the number of people, the difficulty of management and the amount of information of the people are also becoming larger and larger, and the traditional manual management mode can no longer meet the needs of the current society. There are many defects in traditional management methods, such as low maintenance of personnel information data, difficulty in storage and storage, loss of some data, documents, and so on. In order to remedy the above shortcomings, I analyzed the management status of today's societies and developed a set of general-purpose, flexible, tool-based software specifically designed for the management of societies to help them better manage employee registration, evaluation, and notification. This topic is created with this goal, and summarizes the needs of each community. It explains in detail the design, analysis and implementation of the community integrated tool management system.

The community management system mainly includes six lightweight tools to assist the community administrators in managing members. They are: registration management, assessment system, SMS notification platform, duty watch production tool, learning discussion platform, and email notification platform. Because of their different functions, we chose three different technologies to develop these six tools to speed up development. In combination with the excellent open source framework and numerous open source projects on GitHub, based on the website development, the final design and implementation of this set of community management of this integrated tool system. I believe that this instrumentalized, diversified, and networked management platform is a management technology that most university societies need, especially in student groups that are popular among undergraduates. This technology can help them The management upper level allows the associations to walk on the path of standardization, technology, and high efficiency. Really change from single-type management to comprehensive type.
