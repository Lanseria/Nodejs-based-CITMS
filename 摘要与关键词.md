随着科技越来越深入人们的生活，再加之编程技术在入门门槛上越来越低，越来越多的人进入了程序员的行列，我们希望将来的生活能与科技结合起来，使我们感受到科技的进步原来可以帮助到我们这么多事情。我们作为大学生，看到社团的不断发展与人数的增加，其管理难度与人员的信息量也同样日益变大，传统的人工管理模式已经不能满足现在的社团需求。传统的管理方式经分析也有许多缺陷，存在人员信息数据维护效率低下，不易保管储存，容易丢失一些数据，文档等等。为了弥补以上缺点，我分析了当今社团管理状况，开发出一套通用的，灵活的专门为社团管理使用的工具式软件，帮助他们更好里管理人员报名，考核，通知等一些列工作。本课题就是以这一目标创立，并总结了各社团的需求，详细讲解了社团集成工具式管理系统的设计，分析与实现方法。

本社团管理系统主要包含六个轻量级的工具，来协助社团管理员管理成员，分别是：报名管理，考核系统，短信通知平台，值班表制作工具，学习讨论平台，邮件通知平台。为了适应它们各自功能的不同，来加快开发效率，其中我们选用了3种不同的技术去开发这六大工具。结合着优秀的开源框架与 GitHub 上众多的开源项目，在网站开发的基础之上，最终设计实现社团管理这套集成工具式系统。我相信这种网络化，多样化的管理平台是部分大学社团的一项创新工程，特别是在人群范围广，深受大学生欢迎的学生社团，这个技术能帮助他们使社团走在规范化，科技化高效率的道路上。真正从单一型管理向综合型转变。

# Abstract

As technology becomes more and more in-depth in people's lives, and programming technology is getting lower and lower in entry barriers, more and more people are entering the ranks of programmers. We hope that future life can be combined with technology to make us feel The advancement in science and technology could have helped us so many things. As college students, we see the continuous development of the community and the increase in the number of people. The difficulty in managing them and the amount of information of the people are also growing. The traditional manual management model can no longer meet the needs of the current society. The traditional management methods have many defects after analysis. There is low maintenance of personnel information data, it is not easy to store, and it is easy to lose some data, documents and so on. In order to remedy the above shortcomings, I analyzed the management status of today's societies and developed a set of general-purpose, flexible, tool-based software specifically designed for community management to help them better manage employee registration, assessment, and notification. This topic is created with this goal, and summarizes the needs of each community. It explains in detail the design, analysis and implementation of the community integrated tool management system.

The community management system mainly includes six lightweight tools to assist the community administrators in managing members. They are: registration management, assessment system, SMS notification platform, duty watch production tool, learning discussion platform, and email notification platform. In order to adapt to the differences in their respective functions, to speed up the development of efficiency, we chose three different technologies to develop these six tools. Combining an excellent open source framework with numerous open source projects on GitHub, based on the development of the website, the ultimate design and implementation of the community management of this integrated tool system. I believe that this kind of networked and diversified management platform is an innovative project of some university societies, especially student societies that are popular among undergraduates and that are popular among college students. This technology can help them to make the community go standard and technological. High efficiency on the road. Really change from single-type management to comprehensive type.
