# 社团集成工具式管理系统设计与实现

## 摘要

随着科技越来越深入人们的生活，再加之 Coding 编程技术在入门门槛上越来越低，我们越来越希望繁重的人力活能够被一些科技所代替，如：无人超市，无人驾驶等等。在众多行业中，我们作为大学生并不是不可以参与进来，看到大学生社团的管理难度，我们从自己的计算机专业入手，分析当今社团管理人员的难度，痛点，并对其人员的报道，考核等需要大量人力的地方，用管理软件进行代替。开发出一套通用的，灵活的专门为社团管理使用的工具式软件，帮助他们更好里管理人员报名，考核，通知等等一些列工作。本课题就是以这一目标创立，并总结了各社团的需求，详细讲解了社团集成工具式管理系统的设计，分析与实现方法。

本社团管理系统主要包含六个轻量级的工具，来协助社团管理员管理成员，分别是：报名管理，考核系统（这两者采用 PHP 开发模式），短信通知平台，值班表制作工具，学习讨论平台（这三者采用 Express 框架开发），邮件通知平台（Vue 前后端开发）。为了适应它们各自功能的不同，来加快开发效率，其中我们选用了3种不同的技术去开发这六大工具。结合着优秀的开源框架与 GitHub 上众多的开源项目，在网站开发的基础之上，最终设计实现社团管理这套集成工具式系统。我相信这种网络化，多样化的管理平台是部分大学社团的一项创新工程，特别是在人群范围广，深受大学生欢迎的学生社团，这个技术能帮助他们使社团走在规范化，科技化高效率的道路上。真正从单一型管理向综合型转变。

## Abstract

As technology becomes more and more in-depth in people's lives, and Coding programming technology is getting lower and lower in entry barriers, we increasingly hope that heavy manpower can be replaced by technologies such as: unmanned supermarkets, driverless vehicles, etc. Wait. In many industries, we, as college students, are not unable to participate. We see the difficulty of management of college students' associations. We start from our own computer specialties, analyze the difficulty, pain points, and report on their personnel, assessment, etc. Where there is a lot of manpower, replace it with management software. Develop a set of general-purpose, flexible tool-based software specifically designed for community management to help them better manage employee registrations, assessments, notifications, and more. This topic is created with this goal, and summarizes the needs of each community. It explains in detail the design, analysis and implementation of the community integrated tool management system.

The community management system mainly includes six lightweight tools to assist the community administrators to manage members. They are: registration management, assessment system (both using PHP development model), SMS notification platform, duty watchmaking tool, learning Discussion platforms (these three are developed using the Express framework), email notification platforms (Vue front-end development). In order to adapt to the differences in their respective functions, to speed up the development of efficiency, we chose three different technologies to develop these six tools. Combining an excellent open source framework with numerous open source projects on GitHub, based on the development of the website, the ultimate design and implementation of the community management of this integrated tool system. I believe that this kind of networked and diversified management platform is an innovative project of some university societies, especially student societies that are popular among undergraduates and that are popular among college students. This technology can help them to make the community go standard and technological. High efficiency on the road. Really change from single-type management to comprehensive type.
